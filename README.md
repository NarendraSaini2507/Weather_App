Weather App

Overview

This project is a simple weather application created using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It allows users to input a city name and fetch the weather information dynamically.

Features

Input field for users to enter a city name.

Displays weather information in a designated area (#weather-box).

Uses JavaScript to fetch and display weather data.

Simple and responsive UI with a card-based layout.

Project Structure

index.html - The main HTML file containing the structure of the application.

style.css - The CSS file for styling the layout and components.

app.js - The JavaScript file responsible for fetching and displaying weather data.

How It Works

The user enters a city name in the input field (#inp).

JavaScript fetches weather data (likely from an API) and updates #weather-box with the results.

The weather details are displayed dynamically inside the UI.

How to Run

Download or copy the index.html, style.css, and app.js files.

Open index.html in a web browser.

Enter a city name to retrieve and display weather details.

Customization

Modify style.css to change the layout, colors, and fonts.

Update app.js to use different weather APIs or add more weather details.

Improve error handling for invalid city names or API failures.

Dependencies

No external libraries or frameworks are required. The project runs purely on HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
